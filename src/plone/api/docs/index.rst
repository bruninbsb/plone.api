*******************************
A Plone API
*******************************

.. topic:: Overview

    The :mod:`plone.api` is an elegant and simple API, built for humans wishing
    to develop with Plone.


When documenting plone, an easy and understandable set of basic functions helps
to keep the documentation focused on the current task and to keep it simple and
small.

Instead of documenting the ZCA over and over again, we want to describe how to
work with plone.

We want a simple entry point for 20% of tasks we do 80% of the time. Keeping
everything in one place helps keep the API introspectable and discoverable,
which are important aspects of being Pythonic.
